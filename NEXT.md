## Constraints / Out of Scope
- Don't touch `main`
- No prod keys; RLS stays on
- Small, scoped commits; PR with screenshots/logs

## Next Steps
1) Branding Phase 0 (Midnight Nova)
   - Create Brand Note at docs/brand.md
   - Align scope/acceptance and guardrails in NEXT.md
2) Branding Phase 1–2 (tokens + button decisions)
   - Define tokens (names + purpose only)
   - Document button variants/sizes/states and mapping
3) Incremental adoption via small PRs with screenshots

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed
- Should we add more handoff fields to NEXT.md?
- Do we need additional CI checks beyond UNFILLED detection?

Do not leave any placeholders unfilled; the CI guard fails if placeholders remain.
