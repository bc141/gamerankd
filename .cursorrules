# Handoff & Context Rules
Before planning or coding:
- Read the repo-root NEXT.md.
- Read the current PR description.
- Read the latest AI review comment (look for the marker: <!-- ai-review -->).
- Summarize those three in 5 bullets before proposing changes.

When finishing any task:
- Update NEXT.md (replace all UNFILLED placeholders).
- Ensure PR description mirrors NEXT.md sections (copy/paste).
- Push small, scoped commits; never commit to main.

Never:
- Print secrets in logs or PRs.
- Put service keys into client code.

# Quick Change Logging
Use `./scripts/log-change.sh "Description"` to quickly log changes to NEXT.md.
